* Submission Date: 02-18-2021  
* Score: 2708th / 3900 (Top 70%)

## Resources
* Based on [Kaggle Notebook - Cassava classification - EDA & fastai starter](https://www.kaggle.com/tanlikesmath/cassava-classification-eda-fastai-starter)

## Overview
* **Goal**: Classify images of Cassava leaves into one of four disease categories or a healthy category
* **Preprocessing**: image processing was performed using fast.ai Data Loaders at the image (random cropping) and batch level (flip, rotate, zoom, warp, lighting transforms)
* **Modeling**: Transfer learning was applied to an EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network model using fast.ai
